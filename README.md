Instagram Embed for React Native
Thanks to GaborWnuk

## What is it for?
Simple as that - we needed Instagram embeds in our application, and couldn't find anything decent on the internet.

Feel free to contribute.

## How does it work?

Use it to display standard Instagram embed "natively" (without WebView).
